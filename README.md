# Implementing-TCP-with-UDP
During the study of computer network, I have a certain understanding of UDP transmission and TCP transmission, and think about how to achieve the effect of UDP transmission into TCP transmission through the algorithm.
I refer to the GO - BACK - N and the thought of the Sliding Window simply achieved this goal. This project requires running both the sender's py and the receiver's py on your local computer.
